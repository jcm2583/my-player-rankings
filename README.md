# MPR (My Player Rankings)

## Description

_Duration: 2 Weeks_

Fantasy football is an extremely popular industry with many resources offering rankings on which players will perform the best, yet there are not a lot of resources that allow a user to voice their own opinion and create their own player rankings list. I created MPR to be an interactive fantasy football application that aims to solve this issue by offering user interaction. A user can view player stats, create and edit a player rankings list, and keep track of selected players through a sleeper list. A user can create their own profile using a login and registration so that it is personalized to thier choices.

## Usage

1. Login at the homepage. If you do not have an account, you can click on the `Create Account` button 
2. Once logged in, you can add players to your player rankings table by adding their information into the text boxes. Adding a URL will create a hyperlink on the player's name so that you can view that player's stats. There is also a table below that is pre-populated with players so that you can add them to your table in a more efficient manner
3. Once you have added players to your table, you can click on the arrow buttons to increase or decrease their rankings
4. Above your player rankings table, there are links that will organize the table based on the selected position. The arrow buttons will now increase or 
decrease the positional rank instead of the overall rank 
5. If you want to remove a player from your rankings, simply click on the orange subraction icon to the right of the arrows
6. The My Player Rankings page is accessible by clicking on the MPR icon in the top left-hand corner of the page
7. There is a Top Performers tab that allows you to view the top-5 performers at each position from the following year
8. There is a Consensus Rankings tab that will show a table of the top-ranked players to offer guidance as you create your own player rankings
9. There is also a My Sleepers tab that will allow you to add players that you want to track. Once added, these players will show below in a card format
